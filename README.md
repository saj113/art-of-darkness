2D game using Unity3d

Around 2017, I decided to practice designing a relatively simple architecture, and nothing seemed more interesting to me than developing my own small game for mobiles.

As I was working with .NET at that time, I chose Unity3D as the platform. My main priority was to put the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Gang of Four Design Patterns into practical use during the development process.
